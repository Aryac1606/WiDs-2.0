1. The Objective: Decoding the "Startup" Phase
When we look at Tesla ($TSLA$) today, we see a global leader. But back in 2010 to 2012, Tesla was a high-risk pioneer. This project uses the ARIMA model to look back at those first 30 months of trading. My goal was to see if the stock’s early movements followed a logical, predictable pattern as the company transitioned from its IPO to the launch of the Model S.
2. Preparing the Timeline: Cleaning the Early Data
Before the model could "learn" Tesla’s behavior, I had to prepare the dataset. In these early years, Tesla was a "penny stock" by today's standards (trading around $1.15 to $2.00 after adjusting for splits).Fixing the Calendar: Stock markets take breaks, but math doesn't. I used Forward Filling to bridge weekends and holidays, creating a continuous day-by-day story of the stock’s price.The Stability Check: A stock that's just starting out often has "unstable" price action. I used ACF and PACF plots to see how long investors’ memories lasted—meaning, how much yesterday’s news continued to impact today’s price.3. The Strategy: Custom-Fitting the ModelI didn't just use a generic model. I ran a Grid Search to "audition" hundreds of different parameter combinations ($p, d, q$) to find the one that fit Tesla's early-day volatility like a glove.The "Honesty" Metric: I used the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to pick the winner. It's a way of making sure the model is smart enough to see the trend, but not so "over-thinky" that it gets distracted by random market noise.The Blind Test: I trained the model on 80% of the data and then asked it to "predict" the final 20%. This was the ultimate test: could the model predict the 2012 price run-up using only data from 2010 and 2011?
4. The Verdict: Measuring the Predictions
When we compared the model’s guesses to what actually happened, we looked at three major numbers: MAE, MSE, and RMSE.The "Pink Cloud": On the graph, you’ll see a 95% Confidence Interval. This represents the model’s "margin of error." In 2010–2012, this cloud was relatively stable, showing that Tesla was trading in a much more predictable range than it does today.
5. The "Check Engine" Light: Residual Analysis
To make sure the model wasn't making biased mistakes, I looked at the Residuals—the bits of price action the model couldn't explain.Pure Randomness: I checked to see if these errors looked like "white noise." If they were random, it meant the model had successfully extracted all the useful information from the data.The Symmetry Test: I plotted the errors on a histogram. A nice bell curve showed that the model’s mistakes were equal on both sides, proving it wasn't consistently "too optimistic" or "too pessimistic."
6. Final Perspective: A Time of Steady Growth
This analysis proves that in its earliest years, Tesla’s stock was surprisingly grounded in traditional statistical trends. While the ARIMA model is great at capturing this "steady-state" momentum, it serves as a reminder that 2012 was the calm before the storm. As Tesla grew from a niche carmaker into a tech phenomenon, its patterns became more complex, requiring the solid foundational understanding we've built here
